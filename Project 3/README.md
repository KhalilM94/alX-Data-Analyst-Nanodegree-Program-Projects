> This article examines a dataset that includes roughly 183,412 trips from a Ford GoBike. This data collection contains details on each ride taken in a bike-sharing programme that serves the greater San Francisco Bay area.

> This project made use of a dataset of 174952 records and 15 columns.
    - It has information about the trip, like when it starts and when it ends.
    - It holds various information on the bike's user, including member gender and user type 
    - It also includes information regarding the station, some of which include the start_station_name, start_station_id, the
    start_station_longitude...
    - And has numerous columns with categorical datatypes, named bike_share_for_all_trip for instance, with which a number of
    explorations and conclusions were drawn.


## Summary of Findings

> Most variables i ploted seemed to follow normal trends, especially the plot depicting which hour of the day with the highest bike usage. The resulting bimodal distribution holds a highly strong explanation about the purposes behind these kind of rides.

> There is no linear link between the members' ages and the length of their travels.

> Trips duration during the week days tend to be shorter than those who use them on weekends.

> Females and members of other genders had lengthier bike excursions on average than male members.

> Trips including bike sharing have a higher proportion of elderly adults than those that do not. 


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Some of the conclusion I was able to highlight during this analysis are the following:
    - A population with an age between 25 and 40, has the most representation in this dataset
    - Bike trips are most likely to be used by non-subscribers
    - The fact that motorcyclists typically do not share bikes when travelling is also noteworthy.
    - Trips duration during the week days tend to be shorter than those who use them on weekends.
